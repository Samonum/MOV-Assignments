# Cache Simulator
Cache Simulator made to compare different cache eviction policies.

All settings are in [cache.h](../Cache%20Simulator/cache.h), including which policy to test.  
Most important code is in [cache.cpp](/Cache%20Simulator/cache.cpp).  
For more details see [the report](/Cache%20Simulator/Cache_Simulator_Report.pdf).
