First of, we add white space to the code, to make it more readable. An additional benifit to this is that profilers such as VerySleepy give the time required per line, so if there are multiple instructions on a single line, it is difficult to pinpoint which instruction takes the most time.

First, we need to swap to release for profiling. Using both very sleepy & visual studio profiler

To make every run the same, during profiling, we will disable the userinput.
Possible create a savestate. Things needed:
Of each tank
 alive (bool)
 position (x,y)
 velocity (x,y)

2 tank targets

Can save state with s and load with l

The first run, we just let run for a considerable time. The armies meet and get stuck in the middle.
Report1: Biggest bottlenecks are mountain handling and evade handling of other tanks.
